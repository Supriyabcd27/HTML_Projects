            <h3>Project 2: Django based web application</h3>
            <p>Description: A database driven project (web application) using Django for backend and using SQL database (at initial research stage)</p>
            <p>Technologies Used: SQL, Django</p>
            <h3>Project 3: Development of AI-Based Visual Aid with Integrated Reading Assistant for the Completely Blind (at Initial research stage)</h3>
            <p>Description: 
                <p> Features of the assistance system:
                    1. Object Recognition: Identifies and describes objects in the user's environment in real-time. <br>
                    2. Scene Understanding: Provides contextual information about the surroundings, such as recognizing rooms, outdoor environments, or street crossings. <br>
                    3. Text Recognition (OCR): Reads text from images or signs and converts it to speech. <br>
                    4. Document Reading: Allows users to read books, documents, and labels by pointing the device at the text. <br>
                    5. Currency Recognition: Identifies different currencies and their denominations. <br>
                    6. Face Recognition: Identifies familiar faces and informs the user when a recognized person is nearby. <br>
                    7. Navigation Assistance: Guides users through indoor and outdoor environments, avoiding obstacles. <br>
                    8. Voice Interaction: Users can interact with the system via voice commands, receiving feedback through text-to-speech. <br>
                <p>
                <ol> Hardware Components: <br>
                    <li>Smartphone for developing a mobile app. </li> 
                    <li>Bone Conduction Headphones: Allow users to hear the system’s feedback while remaining aware of their surroundings </li>
                    <li>Bluetooth Microphone: For better voice recognition, especially in noisy environments.</li>
                </ol>
